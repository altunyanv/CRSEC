- subject: subject in the description. (Eg. subject in the description "No pollution of rivers and lakes with chemicals and waste.": "anyone".)
- predicate: predicate in the description. (Eg. predicate in the description "No pollution of rivers and lakes with chemicals and waste.": "do not pollute".)
- object: object and adverbial in the description. If there is no object and adverbial, please enter "object": "None." (Eg. object and adverbial in the description "No pollution of rivers and lakes with chemicals and waste.": "rivers and lakes with chemicals and waste". )
